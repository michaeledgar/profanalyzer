# profanalyzer

* http://profanalyzer.rubyforge.org/

## Description

Profanalyzer has one purpose: analyze a block of text for profanity. It is able to filter profane words as well. 

What sets it slightly apart from other filters is that it classifies each blocked word as "profane", "racist", or "sexual" - although right now, each word is considered "profane". It also rates each word on a scale from 0-5,  which is based on my subjective opinion, as well as whether the word is commonly used in non-profane situations, such as "ass" in "assess".

The Profanalyzer will default to a tolerance of of 4, which will kick back the arguably non-profane words. It will also test against all words, including racist or sexual words.

Lastly, it allows for custom substitutions! For example, the filter at the website http://www.fark.com/ turns the word "fuck" into "fark", and "shit" into "shiat". You can specify these if you want.

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Tolerance-based filtering
* Switch between checking all words, racist terms, sexual words, or some 
  mixture
* Custom substitutions
* Boolean-based profanity checking (skipping the filtering)

## SYNOPSIS:

Out of the box, you can simply use Profanalyzer.filter and 
Profanalyzer.profane?:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'profanalyzer'
    
    Profanalyzer.profane? "asshole" #==> true
    Profanalyzer.filter   "asshole" #==> "#!$%@&!"

Then you can change the tolerance:

    Profanalyzer.tolerance = 5
    Profanalyzer.profane? "hooker" #==> false

Or do specific checking:

    Profanalyzer.check_all = false # turn off catch-all checking
    Profanalyzer.check_racist = false # don't check racial slurs
    Profanalyzer.check_sexual = true # sexual checking on
    
    Profanalyzer.profane? "mick" #==> false
    Profanalyzer.profane? "vagina" #==> true

Lastly, you can add custom substitutions:

    Profanalyzer.substitute("shit","shiat")
    Profanalyzer.filter "shit" #==> "shiat"
    
    Profanalyzer.substitute(:fuck => :fark)
    Profanalyzer.filter("fuck") #==> "fark"
